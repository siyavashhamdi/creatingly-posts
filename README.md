## Project Definition

This project is a React application created using Create-React-App. It serves as a foundation for building modern, scalable web applications for Creatingly company.
Based on Assessment:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0_MzjiMOplZ5iLuQ2RWfXYmxBMaSSwztZW0hQCTbBM-M7Hw/viewform

You can tune the app by constant variables from here `src/constants/common.constant.ts`
The app is fully commented for each block, please refer to the code for the strategy that I have used.

## Prerequisites to Run the App

- Node.js v20+ installed on your machine
- npm (Node Package Manager)

# How to Run

### `npm i`

Run this command to install all the necessary packages.

### `npm start`

This command launches the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
The page will reload if you make edits, and you'll see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for cache busting.
